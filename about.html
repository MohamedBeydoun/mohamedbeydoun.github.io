        <div class="about">
            <img src="css/res/about1.jpg">
            <p>Current Computer Science student and aspiring traveler. I am 
                objective-oriented, highly focused, and very passionate about 
                new forms of technology. I enjoy 
                learning new technologies and expanding my skill-set to better suit both my current and 
                future projects. While I am capable of working alone, I enjoy working 
                in collaboration with other programmers as it is a great learning
                opportunity and a chance to look at problems from a different 
                point of view.</p>

                climb all over the world.
